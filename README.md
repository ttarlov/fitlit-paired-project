## Summary:
FitLit is a dashboard representation of a large dataset of users, their activity, sleep and hydration data. The goal of this project was to take multiple datasets and display it for individual user in an easy to understand visual representation. This is similar to what you would get from a fitness tracker like Apple Watch or Fitbit. 

The specifications for this project can be found here <a href="https://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html">here</a>.

## How to Install: 

- Clone the repo to your local machine via terminal.
- Open index.html locally.


## How to Use: 
After you have opened index.html in your browser every time you refresh the page a new user info is presented. You can see particular users step, hydration, and activity data and how it compares to other users in the dataset. 

Currently the date is fixed to the last day in the dataset. The future functionality will allow to pick any date. Users are picked at random every time the page is refreshed. 

## Learning Goals: 
- Practice using OOP and TDD.
- Write Dry JavaScript with reusable functions. 
- Use objects and array prototypes to manipulate the data. 
- Have a usable and easy to understand UI. 


## Technologies Used:
- HTML5 
- JavaScript ES6/ES5
- Chai/Mocha for testing
- Css
